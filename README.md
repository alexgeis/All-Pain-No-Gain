# Project-2- All Pain No Gain

## Overview

Welcome to our Project 2! This is another important milestone in our full-stack journey: designing and building our first full-stack web application. Our team designed and built an app using the MVC paradigm, own server-side API, user authentication, and connection to a database.

## The Work

With our team, we conceived and executed a design that solves a real-world problem. In creating our first collaborative full-stack application, we combined a robust back end--with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authenticationâ€”-to an intuitive front end. We continued to build on the agile development methodologies we've used throughout this course, like storing our project code in GitHub, managing our work with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.

## User Story

Whether you're a health fiend, a casual gym-goer and broccoli-eater, or just getting started; we designed an app that will encompass all your health-tracking needs in one spot. This app will inspire you with motivational quotes, help you track your food intake and exercise, offer you calorie counting resources, and provide tips for workouts/eating better.

### General

This app first presents you with our welcome page that has an inspirational quote that is randomly generated with an API. Once you click the "Get Started" button, you are taken to a login/sign-up page that will ask for your credentials. Once submitted, you are directed to the main page. On the main page you will find a side menu, calendar, header, and footer. This side menu has different button options that- once clicked- will dropdown a menu of specific choices pertaining to that category. The user can drag and drop these choices anywhere on the calendar to either mark what they've done, or mark what they will do. This can be used to scehdule their week, track their progress, etc. There are two buttons on the top of the calendar, "Add meal", and "Add workout", that also let the user enter specific data they would like displayed on the calendar that is not listed on the side menu. With all the being said, the user is not limited to just entering meals and workouts on the calendar. They can also click any date on the calendar and enter any kind of input they would like. The footer on the main page contains four links that the user can follow to a calorie counter for food, a calorie tracker for workouts, healthy food alternative suggestions, and tips to get your workout on at home.
